## Required Customizations

Before launching, replace these placeholders in all documents:

1. **[DATE]** - Replace with the actual date when terms go into effect
2. **[DOMAIN]** - Replace with your actual domain name (e.g., apidirect.com)
3. **[COMPANY ADDRESS]** - Replace with your registered business address
4. **[JURISDICTION]** - Replace with your legal jurisdiction (e.g., "State of Delaware, USA")

## Implementation Notes

1. **Routing**: The pages are already created in the Next.js pages directory, so they'll be accessible at:
   - `/legal/terms`
   - `/legal/privacy`
   - `/legal/cookies`
   - `/legal/refund`
   - `/legal/api-terms`

2. **Styling**: All pages use consistent dark theme styling matching the marketplace design

3. **Navigation**: Each page includes a "Back to Home" link

4. **SEO**: Each page includes appropriate meta tags for search engines

## Next Steps

1. Have a lawyer review and customize these templates for your jurisdiction
2. Update all placeholder values with actual information
3. Add links to these pages in your website footer
4. Consider adding a cookie consent banner that references the cookie policy
5. Ensure your payment flow includes acceptance of the terms

These templates are provided as a starting point only. They should be reviewed and customized by a qualified attorney before use in production. Laws vary by jurisdiction, and you may need additional or different terms based on your specific business model and location.
