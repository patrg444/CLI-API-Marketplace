## Usage

### Search Functionality
Users can now:
1. Use the search bar with autocomplete suggestions
2. Apply multiple filters simultaneously
3. Sort results by various criteria
4. See faceted results with category counts

### Review System
Authenticated users with active subscriptions can:
1. Submit reviews with ratings and comments
2. Vote on review helpfulness
3. See verified purchase badges
4. Read creator responses to reviews

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test search with various queries
- [ ] Verify filter combinations work correctly
- [ ] Test search suggestions responsiveness
- [ ] Submit a review as a subscribed user
- [ ] Test review voting functionality
- [ ] Verify non-subscribers cannot submit reviews
- [ ] Test pagination for both search results and reviews
- [ ] Verify URL parameters persist on page refresh

## Next Steps

1. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for failed searches or review submissions
2. **Loading States**: Enhance loading indicators for better UX
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
4. **Performance**: Consider implementing virtual scrolling for large result sets
5. **Analytics**: Add tracking for search queries and filter usage

## Known Limitations

1. Search suggestions are fetched on every keystroke after debounce
2. Review editing is not yet implemented
3. Creator response functionality needs backend integration
4. Search relevance scoring may need tuning based on user feedback
