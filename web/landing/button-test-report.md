## Button Functionality Issues

### 1. **Placeholder Links** 
6 links point to "#" with no actual destination:
- These should either be removed or linked to actual pages
- Currently they do nothing when clicked

### 2. **"Learn About BYOA" Button**
- Styled as a button but has no action
- Should either open a modal or link to more info

### 3. **External Links Status**
- docs.apidirect.dev → Domain not configured (will fail)
- Social media links → Go to generic pages (not actual company profiles)

## Mobile Menu Test
- [x] Hamburger menu button works
- [x] Mobile menu shows/hides correctly
- [x] All mobile menu links function identically to desktop

## JavaScript Interactions
- [x] Smooth scroll works on all anchor links
- [x] Form submission shows success message
- [x] Terminal animation triggers on scroll
- [x] Hover effects work on all buttons

## Overall Score: 22/30 buttons fully functional (73%)

### Recommendations:
1. Remove or implement the 6 placeholder links
2. Add functionality to "Learn About BYOA" button
3. Set up docs.apidirect.dev subdomain
4. Create actual social media profiles
