## Local Development Testing

### 1. Test Creator Publishing Flow
```bash
# Login as creator
apidirect auth login --type creator

# Publish an API
apidirect publish my-api --description "My awesome API" --category "AI/ML" --tags "nlp,text"

# Set pricing
cat > pricing.json << EOF
{
  "plans": [
    {
      "name": "Free",
      "type": "free",
      "call_limit": 1000,
      "rate_limit_per_minute": 10
    },
    {
      "name": "Pro",
      "type": "subscription",
      "monthly_price": 49.99,
      "call_limit": 100000,
      "rate_limit_per_minute": 100
    }
  ]
}
EOF
apidirect pricing set my-api --plan-file pricing.json

# Check marketplace info
apidirect marketplace info my-api
```

### 2. Test Consumer Flow
- Visit http://localhost:3001
- Create consumer account
- Browse APIs
- View API details with pricing
- Access dashboard (currently shows placeholders)

## Architecture Decisions

### Payment Flow
1. **Consumers**: Pay via Stripe Billing with subscriptions
2. **Platform**: Takes 20% commission automatically
3. **Creators**: Receive 80% via Stripe Connect payouts

### Rate Limiting Strategy
- **Free Tier**: 1,000 calls/day, 10/minute
- **Basic Tier**: 50,000 calls/day, 60/minute  
- **Pro Tier**: 500,000 calls/day, 100/minute
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

### Search Architecture
- Start with PostgreSQL full-text search
- Migrate to Elasticsearch for scale
- Index: API names, descriptions, tags, documentation

## Security Checklist

- [x] API keys hashed with SHA256
- [x] Rate limiting at gateway level
- [x] Authentication required for all services
- [x] Consumer/Creator role separation
- [x] Stripe webhook signature verification
- [ ] PCI compliance for payment handling
- [ ] GDPR compliance for data handling

## Deployment Considerations

### Kubernetes Resources
- All services configured with autoscaling
- Redis deployed for rate limiting
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Ingress configured for routing

### Environment Variables
```env
# Required for production
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
