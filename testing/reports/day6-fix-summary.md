# Day 6 Fix Summary

**Date**: May 28, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Analysis Complete  

## Accessibility Issues

### Images Without Alt Attributes
**Finding**: All images in application code already have proper alt attributes!
- The 71 images detected were in node_modules (not our code)
- No fixes needed for accessibility

## Code Quality Issues

### Console.log Statements
**Finding**: No console.log or fmt.Println statements found in application code!
- The 2,244 detected were all in node_modules
- No cleanup needed

### TODO Comments
**Finding**: 20 legitimate TODO comments found in services
- These represent actual incomplete features that need implementation

## TODO Comments Breakdown

### Authentication TODOs (High Priority)
1. **services/marketplace/middleware/auth.go**
   - Line 65: Implement creator verification logic
   - Line 82: Implement admin verification logic
   - Line 91: Implement proper Cognito token verification

2. **services/storage/middleware/auth.go**
   - Line 31: Validate JWT token with Cognito
   - Line 41: Parse JWT and extract claims

3. **services/deployment/middleware/auth.go**
   - Line 31: Validate JWT token with Cognito
   - Line 41: Parse JWT and extract claims

### Feature Implementation TODOs
1. **services/marketplace/**
   - handlers/review.go:53: Convert user ID to consumer ID
   - indexer/indexer.go:152: Calculate monthly calls from metering data

2. **services/storage/**
   - handlers/handlers.go:144: Check if user owns this API
   - handlers/handlers.go:171: Implement metadata retrieval
   - handlers/handlers.go:202: Implement metadata update

3. **services/deployment/**
   - handlers/handlers.go:156,187: Verify user owns this API
   - handlers/handlers.go:211: Implement environment variable retrieval
   - handlers/handlers.go:239: Implement environment variable update
   - handlers/handlers.go:265: Implement log streaming from Kubernetes
   - handlers/handlers.go:312: Implement metrics collection

4. **services/metering/**
   - handlers/handlers.go:179: Validate that user owns this API

5. **services/payout/**
   - workers/workers.go:125: Create Stripe transfer

## Summary

### Good News ✅
- **No accessibility issues** in our code
- **No console.log statements** in our code
- **Code is production-ready** from a cleanup perspective

### Areas Needing Work ⚠️
- **20 TODO comments** representing incomplete features
- Most critical: Authentication middleware needs Cognito integration
- Several ownership verification checks missing
- Some advanced features (logs, metrics, env vars) not implemented

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Complete authentication middleware (Cognito integration)
2. **Priority 2**: Implement ownership verification checks
3. **Priority 3**: Complete basic CRUD operations (metadata, env vars)
4. **Priority 4**: Implement advanced features (log streaming, metrics)

The codebase is clean and well-structured, but these TODOs represent functional gaps that should be addressed before production deployment.
