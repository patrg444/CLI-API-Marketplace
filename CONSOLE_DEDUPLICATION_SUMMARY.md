# Console Deduplication Summary

## Duplicates Found and Fixed

### 1. API Client Methods
**Issue**: The `/web/console/api-client-updated.js` file had duplicate method definitions:
- `deployAPI()` was defined twice (lines 146 and 236)
- `deleteAPI()` was defined twice (lines 160 and 258)

**Fix**: Removed the duplicate definitions, keeping only the first occurrence of each method.

### 2. API Client Files
**Status**: Two API client files exist but serve different purposes:
- `/web/console/static/js/api-client.js` - Main API client used by the console (loaded in base.html)
- `/web/console/api-client-updated.js` - Updated version with additional methods (not currently in use)

**Recommendation**: These should be consolidated in the future, but currently no duplication issue as only one is actively used.

## Verified No Duplicates

### Navigation Links
✅ Each monetization page link appears only once in the navigation:
- `/publish` - Publish API
- `/pricing` - Pricing  
- `/earnings` - Earnings

### Page Files
✅ Each page file exists only once:
- `/web/console/pages/publish.html`
- `/web/console/pages/pricing.html`
- `/web/console/pages/earnings.html`

### Method Implementations
✅ No duplicate implementations found in the new monetization pages for:
- `publishToMarketplace()`
- `requestPayout()`
- Pricing update methods

## Current State

The console implementation is now clean with:
- No duplicate method definitions
- No duplicate navigation links
- No duplicate page files
- Clear separation between different API client versions

The monetization features (Publish, Pricing, Earnings) have been added without creating any duplicates in the existing codebase.
