## 🔧 Next Steps

### Add Custom Domains in Vercel Dashboard

For each deployed project:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on the project (console, marketplace, or docs)
3. Go to Settings → Domains
4. Click "Add Domain"
5. Enter the subdomain:
   - For console: `console.apidirect.dev`
   - For marketplace: `marketplace.apidirect.dev`
   - For docs: `docs.apidirect.dev`
6. Vercel will verify DNS (should be instant since DNS records are already set)
7. SSL certificates will be provisioned automatically (5-10 minutes)

### DNS Records Status

✅ All DNS A records are already configured in Namecheap pointing to Vercel IP: 216.198.79.193
- console.apidirect.dev → 216.198.79.193
- marketplace.apidirect.dev → 216.198.79.193
- docs.apidirect.dev → 216.198.79.193
- api.apidirect.dev → 216.198.79.193
