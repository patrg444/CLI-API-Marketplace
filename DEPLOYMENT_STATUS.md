# CLI-API Marketplace Deployment Status

## Current Status: Docker Not Running

The deployment verification shows that Docker is not currently running on your system.

**Error Message:**
```
Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///Users/patrickgloria/.docker/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```

## Steps to Complete Deployment

### 1. Start Docker Desktop

First, you need to start Docker Desktop:

```bash
# On macOS, start Docker Desktop from Applications
open -a Docker
```

Wait for Docker Desktop to fully start (the Docker icon in the menu bar should stop animating).

### 2. Verify Docker is Running

```bash
docker --version
docker ps
```

### 3. Run the Deployment

Once Docker is running, you have several deployment options:

#### Option A: Simple Deployment (Recommended)
This script handles the missing go.sum files automatically:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-simple.sh
```

#### Option B: Quiet Deployment
For less verbose output with progress indicators:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-quiet.sh
```

#### Option C: Manual Docker Compose
If you prefer to see all output:

```bash
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker-compose up -d --build
```

### 4. Monitor Deployment Progress

Use the verification script to monitor the deployment:

```bash
# Wait for all services to be ready
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh wait

# Or check status once
./scripts/verify-deployment.sh once
```

### 5. View Real-time Logs

To see what's happening during deployment:

```bash
# All services
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific services
docker-compose logs -f gateway marketplace billing
```

## Expected Timeline

- **Docker startup**: 1-2 minutes
- **First-time deployment**: 20-30 minutes
  - Infrastructure services: 2-3 minutes
  - Go services: 10-15 minutes (downloading dependencies)
  - Node.js applications: 5-10 minutes

## Service URLs (Once Deployed)

- **Marketplace UI**: http://localhost:3000
- **Creator Portal**: http://localhost:3001
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:8082
- **Elasticsearch**: http://localhost:9200
- **Kibana**: http://localhost:5601

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:

1. **Check Docker resources**:
   - Ensure Docker Desktop has at least 4GB RAM allocated
   - Settings > Resources > Advanced

2. **Clean up and retry**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down -v
   docker system prune -f
   ./scripts/deploy-simple.sh
   ```

3. **Check specific service logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs <service-name>
   ```

### Common Issues:

- **go.sum missing**: Already handled by deploy-simple.sh
- **Port conflicts**: Ensure no other services are using ports 3000, 3001, 8080-8087
- **Disk space**: Ensure at least 10GB free space for Docker images

## Next Steps

1. Start Docker Desktop
2. Run `./scripts/deploy-simple.sh`
3. Monitor with `./scripts/verify-deployment.sh wait`
4. Once all services are green, access the web interfaces

The deployment scripts have been designed to handle the missing go.sum files and other common issues automatically. The first deployment will take longer as it downloads all dependencies, but subsequent deployments will be much faster.
