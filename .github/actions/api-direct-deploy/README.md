# API-Direct Deploy Action

Deploy your APIs to the API-Direct platform and optionally publish them to the marketplace directly from GitHub Actions.

## Features

- üöÄ **One-click deployment** from GitHub to API-Direct
- üì¢ **Automatic marketplace publishing** with metadata
- üß™ **Built-in API testing** after deployment
- üìã **Rich deployment summaries** in GitHub
- üí¨ **PR preview deployments** with automatic comments
- üîÑ **Multi-environment support** (staging, production)

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up your API-Direct token

Add your API-Direct token as a repository secret:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Secrets and variables" ‚Üí "Actions"
3. Add a new secret named `API_DIRECT_TOKEN`
4. Paste your API-Direct API key as the value

### 2. Create a workflow file

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to API-Direct

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Deploy to API-Direct
        uses: api-direct/deploy-action@v1
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.API_DIRECT_TOKEN }}
          publish: true
          description: "My awesome API"

    api-key: ${{ secrets.API_DIRECT_TOKEN }}
    publish: true

- name: Run integration tests
  run: |
    API_URL="${{ steps.deploy.outputs.api-url }}"
    curl -f "$API_URL/health"
    
- name: Notify team
  run: |
    echo "API deployed to: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.api-url }}"
    echo "Marketplace: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.marketplace-url }}"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Failed**
- Ensure your `API_DIRECT_TOKEN` secret is set correctly
- Verify the token has deployment permissions

**apidirect.yaml Not Found**
- Make sure your repository contains an `apidirect.yaml` file
- Use `working-directory` input if the file is in a subdirectory

**Deployment Timeout**
- Large APIs may take longer to deploy
- Check the API-Direct status page for service issues

**Marketplace Publishing Failed**
- Ensure `description` is provided when `publish: true`
- Check that your API meets marketplace requirements

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG` secret to `true` in your repository.

## Security

- Never commit API keys to your repository
- Use GitHub secrets for sensitive information
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different keys for different environments
