## 💡 Risk Mitigation

### **Technical Risks**
- **IAM complexity**: Start with broad permissions, narrow later
- **Terraform state**: Use S3 backend with locking
- **User errors**: Comprehensive validation and error messages

### **Business Risks**
- **User adoption**: Focus on developer experience
- **Competition**: Emphasize unique BYOA value proposition
- **Scaling**: Start simple, add complexity as needed

## 🎯 Success Factors

1. **Developer Experience**: Make deployment truly effortless
2. **Trust**: Transparent security model builds confidence
3. **Value**: Clear ROI vs manual AWS setup
4. **Community**: Early adopters become advocates
5. **Iteration**: Fast feedback loops and improvements

---

**Next Steps**: Begin Week 1 tasks immediately. Focus on orchestration service refactor as the critical path to MVP.

**Timeline**: 4 weeks to MVP, 6 weeks to public launch
**Team Focus**: 100% on core deployment flow until it works perfectly
**Success Metric**: User can deploy a working API in under 5 minutes
